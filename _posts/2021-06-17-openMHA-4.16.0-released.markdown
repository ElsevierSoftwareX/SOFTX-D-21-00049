__openMHA 4.16.0__ provides support of NAL-NL2 and DSLmio5 fitting rules

In this release of openMHA, the openMHA fitting tools (mhagui_fitting.m and mhagui_fitting_offline.m) were extended to work with NAL-NL2 and DSLmio5 gain prescription rules in case these are available on the user's computer. For details, see corresponding README files:
[NAL-NL2](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/README_NALNL2.md) [DSLmio5](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/README_DSLmio5.md).
Further, a [template file](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/blob/master/mha/tools/mfiles/gainrule_template.m) for the implementation of own fitting rules was added to the tool set.

Another extension of the openMHA tool set is a new graphical user interface for Matlab that can be used to control the generic hearing aid setup provided with the [Mahalia](http://mahalia.openmha.org/) operating system for the Portable Hearing Laboratory (see [Hardware](/hardware)).

The PortAudio audio IO-library was made more flexible in order to extend audio interface support, in particular for portable hardware platforms.
       
An [example](https://github.com/HoerTech-gGmbH/openMHA/tree/master/examples/29-python-examples) how to interface openMHA with the Python language has been added.
